# Installation

**Pip Install**

`pip install tamr_toolbox[all]`
  

**Optional Features**

Some features of Tamr-Toolbox require additional dependencies. You can opt-in to these features during installation. By including `tamr_toolbox[all]` in the pip installation command, you will install the dependencies required for all optional features. To include dependencies required for one or more optional features use `tamr_toolbox[feature_1, feature_2]`. A minimal installation is achieved by omitting the `[]` entirely.

In some cases you may already have a version of the library installed and would prefer to use that instead. Or perhaps
you would like better control over what version you are installing. 
If doing so, please use at least minimum version of the library specified below. 
You will then want to install a version of tamr-toolbox
without that library included (such as the version with no optional features) so that it does not attempt to change 
your existing version.

Deliver the `.zip` file to the target machine where you want `tamr-toolbox` installed. You can do this via email, cloud drives, `scp` or any other mechanism.

```
