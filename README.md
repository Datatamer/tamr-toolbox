Tamr-Toolbox is a python library created to provide a simple interface for common interactions with Tamr and common data workflows that include Tamr. The more specialized [Tamr-Client](https://github.com/Datatamer/tamr-client) python library is used for direct interactions with Tamr in both the development of the Tamr-Toolbox and in the recommended use of the Tamr-Toolbox.
